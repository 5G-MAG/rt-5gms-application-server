#
# This is an example configuration file for the 5G-MAG Reference Tools 5GMS
# Application Server. This file contains a description of the configuration
# settings available and their default values.
#

### Defaults for the 5G-MAG Reference Tools: 5GMS applications
[DEFAULT]
#log_dir = /var/log/rt-5gms
#run_dir = /run/rt-5gms



### 5GMS Application Server specific configurations
[5gms_as]
# log_level - The logging level for the 5GMS Application Server
#
# This sets the minimum logging level of the 5GMS Application Server.
# The field can be one of: debug, info, warn, error or fatal.
#
# Default is info
#log_level = info

# cache_dir - The directory to hold cached objects in
#
# The actual format of files and subdirectories within this directory is
# dependant on the web proxy/server chosen at run-time.
#
# If this setting is empty or omitted then the web proxy/server will run
# without a disk cache.
#
# For the nginx web proxy it is advisable to locate this directory on the same
# filesystem partition as the temporary directories to make moving objects from
# temporary stores to the disk cache more efficient.
#
# Default is /var/cache/rt-5gms/as/cache
#cache_dir = /var/cache/rt-5gms/as/cache

# docroot - The top level directory which will hold the document roots
#
# This is a directory which will hold the document roots for each virtual
# server. This prefix will be followed by the hostname of the server to which
# this root applies.
#
# Default is /var/cache/rt-5gms/as/docroots
#docroot = /var/cache/rt-5gms/as/docroots

# http_port - The TCP port number to listen for HTTP requests on
#
# This determines which port the web proxy/server will bind to for distribution
# configurations without a security certificate.
#
# The default is port 80
#http_port = 80

# https_port - The TCP port number to listen for TLS based HTTP requests on
#
# This determines which port the web proxy/server will bind to for distribution
# configurations with an associated security certificate.
#
# The default port is 443
#https_port = 443

# m3_listen - The IP address or hostname to listen for M3 requests on
#
# This determines which addresses the M3 configuration channel will bind to
# when listening for new connections from 5GMS Application Functions.
# This interface is used by the 5GMS Application Function to configure the
# 5GMS Application Server.
#
# See also: m3_port
#
# The default listening address is localhost
#m3_listen = localhost

# m3_port - The TCP port number to listen for M3 requests on
#
# This determines which port the M3 configuration channel will listen on.
# This interface is used by the 5GMS Application Function to configure the
# 5GMS Application Server.
#
# See also: m3_listen
#
# The default port is 7777
#m3_port = 7777

# access_log - The location to write the web proxy/server access log.
#
# This is the path to the file to log access requests in.
#
# The default is /var/log/rt-5gms/application-server-access.log
#access_log = %(log_dir)s/application-server-access.log

# error_log - The location to write the web proxy/server access log.
#
# This is the path to the file to log access requests in.
#
# The default is /var/log/rt-5gms/application-server-error.log
#error_log = %(log_dir)s/application-server-error.log

# pid_path - Path for the process identifier for the 5gms application server
#
# The top level process id will be written to this file.
#
# The default is /run/rt-5gms/application-server.pid
#pid_path = %(run_dir)s/application-server.pid

# provisioning_session_id - Provisioning session for this application server
#
# This is the provisioning session identifier for this application server (AS)
# instance. This is the session ID as allocated to the application provider
# (AP) by the application function (AF) during the ProvisioningSessions.
#
# The default is d54a1fcc-d411-4e32-807b-2c60dbaeaf5f
#provisioning_session_id = d54a1fcc-d411-4e32-807b-2c60dbaeaf5f

# m4d_path_prefix - Path prefix for the M4d interface
#
# This is the path prefix that will be used on all media accesses for this
# provisioning session.
#
# The default is /m4d/provisioning-session-<session-id>/
#m4d_path_prefix = /m4d/provisioning-session-%(provisioning_session_id)s/
